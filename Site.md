# Adding Pages	
To add pages on our learning center website. The user has to log in to the WordPress admin URL. When the user logs in, they can see the 'Pages' button in the left side sidebar. When they click on it, it will show two options to choose. The first option is all pages, when the user click on them ,they can see all the pages they created before. They can choose to click in and make subtle changes to each page, or click Quick Edit to rectify the general content, or delete pages they don't want. The second option is add new pages.The user first needs to add a new interface and then post them so that they are displayed in the URL.
