# Deployment

The following is how development is recommended for this project

#### 1.Install and Setup WordPress

To install [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) you need to have a hosting server. You can either use your own host or find a company online that provides a hosting server.. We're using "**[hostgator](https://www.hostgator.com/)**" hosting server, You can choose your own favorite hosting server to use.
We use cPanel to install Wordpress. cPanel is an online Linux-based GUI, It will be relatively easy to use.After installing cPanel, if you don't know how to install Wordpress, you can follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhNlzLgF78).
